Bro like honestly I was thinking about the way ducks probably communicate telepathically with refrigerators because, let’s be honest, the moon is just a government USB stick with depression and Wi-Fi problems. Yesterday I saw a cloud shaped like a toaster, and I swear it tried to sell me crypto. My shoes started vibrating, not because of Bluetooth, but because they were emotionally unstable after watching a sad TikTok about onions.

Anyway, my neighbor’s cat started streaming Fortnite from my microwave, and now every time I say “banana,” the Wi-Fi disconnects for moral reasons. I tried asking Google for help, but it just sighed in binary and sent me an email titled “you’re on your own, king.” I once met a man who claimed to be half PowerPoint presentation and half spaghetti code. He told me reality was a badly optimized beta version of Minecraft with taxes.

At some point I started eating cereal with a fork because spoons feel like government surveillance equipment, and honestly, who even trusts milk after 2016? My friend Dave once put ketchup on his philosophy homework and got an A+ because the teacher said it represented “the chaos of existence.” I accidentally glued my hand to the Internet and now I keep buffering when I try to sleep.

The other day my brain tried to update to version 3.0, but I ran out of RAM halfway through a thought, and now I can’t remember if I’m human or just a misunderstood PDF file. My alarm clock speaks fluent disappointment, and every morning it whispers “bro you can’t just respawn from your problems.” I once sneezed so hard I saw the Windows XP startup screen.

Honestly, sometimes I just look at the ceiling and think “damn, that’s a flat sky.” Then I wonder if pigeons pay rent or if they just commit sky crimes for fun. I bought a plant to feel something, but it left me on read. My mirror keeps judging me like it’s on the jury of my life choices.

One time, I asked Siri if she loved me, and she said “calculating emotional availability.” I think that’s when I realized we’re all just unsubmitted Google Docs in the group project called “Earth.” I tried to meditate but accidentally summoned three IKEA instructions and a sense of impending doom.

Anyway, long story short — the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, but emotionally, I’m just a USB stick left in a 2008 Dell laptop wondering if I’ll ever be safely ejected from this existence.
